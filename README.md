# House_Prices_Project

This repository contains a data science project based on the King County House Sales dataset. The dataset can be found in the file "King_County_House_prices_dataset.csv" in this repository, and a description of the corresponding column names can be found in the “column_names.md” file.

The Data Science Life Cycle goals for this project include: Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization and Predictive Modeling (by linear regression).

All parts of the data analysis are documented in the notebook “House_Prices_Project_Karima.ipynb” and include the following steps:

1.	Load Packages and Dataset

2.	Data Cleaning:
	  1.	Data types (deals with conversion of data types)
	  2.	Missing data (handles missing values)
  
3.	Data Exploration & Visualization
	  1.	Overview of all features (using scatter_matrix plots)
	  2.	Exploring features one by one (histograms, pie/bar charts, scatter/regression plots)
	  3.	Correlation analysis (heatmaps)
	  4.	Folium map (mean price per zipcode)
  
4.	Multiple Regression Model
	  1.	Model fitting and summary statistics
	  2.	Multicollinearity (checking variance inflation factors)
    
5.  Customize Plots for Business Presentation
